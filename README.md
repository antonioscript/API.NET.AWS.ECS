### Pushing Docker Image to Amazon ECR

Open up the Terminal at the location where the DockerFile exists and run the following command. Probably run it line by line.

```
aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 821175633958.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com
```

PS: Make sure that you replace the 821175633958 with your AWS account id

```
docker tag book-manager 821175633958.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/cwm/book-manager
```

```
docker push 821175633958.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/cwm/book-manager
```
